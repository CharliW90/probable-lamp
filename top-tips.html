        <h1>Our Top Tips!</h1>
        <h2>This looks a lot like the <a href="javascript:history.back()">page</a> you just came from...</h1>
        <h3>...but anyway, let's cook...</h2>

        <h2>Espresso Machines on a budget</h2>
        <p>No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one. But you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up.</p>
        <h2>Espresso Grinders on a budget</h2>
        <p>I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? How are you even alive?</p>
        <h3>How important is the grinder? (aka why is it more expensive?)</h3>
        <p>That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus there's an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, you've earned it. We made a deal. That's right. Because I think that we can do business together - we came to an understanding. Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds a week, thirty-five thousand a pound.</p>
        <h2>Espresso Accessories (what to invest in first)</h2>
        <p>Look... I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but once more, I shall try. This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin our batch. And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can cook. Failing that, we're dead. There's no more room for error. Not with these people.</p>
        <h2>Why am I back here?</h2>
        <p>Pick any of the many answers below</p>
        <ul>
            <li>...because you should get used to asking yourself this if you intend to journey into home espresso</li>
            <li>...because Charli has nothing better to do</li>
            <li>...because generating more content without using AI is hard work</li>
            <li>...because generating content with AI looks like this:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To achieve a delicious cup of espresso at home, invest in high-quality, freshly roasted coffee beans, as the freshness of the beans greatly influences the flavor and aroma of your espresso.</li>
                <li>Ensure your espresso machine is properly calibrated by adjusting the grind size, water temperature, and extraction time, as these factors play a crucial role in extracting the full potential of your coffee grounds and creating a rich, balanced espresso.</li>
                <li>Practice the art of tamping, as applying consistent pressure when compacting the coffee grounds in the portafilter ensures even extraction, leading to a smooth and well-balanced espresso shot with a desirable crema on top.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>...because Charli made an internal link that pointed to another page, and now they feel like they need to make that page</li>
            <li>because this is unnecessary faff, which is a good way to summarise Home Espresso</li>
        </ul>
